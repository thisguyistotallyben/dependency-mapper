Ben Design System

## What is the Ben Design System?
It's a fancy bit of CSS that you can just drop into any project and make it look nice and uniform with minimal custom CSS

## Examples
I'll get screenshots in here eventually, but here's some example stuff you can do.
```html
<div class="bds-container">
  <div class="bds-container-header">
    <button class="bds-button bds-button-neutral">Yeet</button>
    <button class="bds-button bds-button-success bds-l-margin-1">Another Button</button>
  </div>
</div>
```
